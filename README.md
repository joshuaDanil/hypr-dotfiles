# hypr-dotfiles
Files for my rice of Hyprland (on Arch Linux)
** This is a very minimalist config and chances are you're going to want to configure some of it yourself, especially your monitor settings in hyprland.config. This is also my first reposity and I don't entirely know what I'm doing, I just wanted to upload my config files to GitHub tbh.**
Replace your .config files with these. (`~/.config`)
Make sure you have `wofi`, `hyprpaper`, and `waybar` installed. Also make sure you have the fonts `otf-font-awesome` and `ttf-roboto-mono` installed to display things correctly.

I would also recommend putting the electron-config in your .config folder to make some apps like Discord not pixelated.

If you want to change the wallpaper, put it in `/hypr/` and name it `image.png`. (Or change `hyprpaper.config` to whatever path you want. If your wallpaper isn't a PNG, you'll probably have to do this anyway.)
