# hypr-dotfiles
Files for my rice of Hyprland (on Arch Linux). Best for laptops.

**This is a fairly minimal config and chances are you're going to want to configure some of it yourself, especially `hyprland.config` and `hypridle.config`.**
## Installation
Download the repository as .zip and `cd` inside the folder (usually `cd ~/Downloads/hyprland-dotfiles-main`). Then run `chmod +x install.sh` and then run `./install.sh`. (I know, I know, but I couldn't figure out how to keep the chmod +x after uploading to GitHub.) 
If you want to change the wallpaper, put it in `/hypr/` and name it either `wallpaper.png` or `lockscreen.png` to use it for your desktop wallpaper or your lockscreen wallpaper. (Or change `hyprpaper.config` and `hyprlock` to whatever path you want. If your wallpaper isn't a PNG, you'll probably have to do this anyway.)
You may want to change your idle settings in `hypridle.config`.
